/// Represents a voice in polyphonic notetion
///
/// In polyphonic music, multiple independent melodic lines (voices)
/// are noteted on the same staff. Each voice is typically distinguished by:
/// - Stem direction (voice 1: up, voice 2: down)
/// - Horizontal offset (voice 2 shifted right)
/// - Different beaming groups
///
/// Examples:
/// - Bach fugues (3-4 voices on one staff)
/// - Piano music (2 voices per hand)
/// - Guitar fingerstyle (melody + accompaniment)
/// - Counterpoint exercises
///
/// Convention:
/// - Voice 1 (top voice): Stems up, no offset
/// - Voice 2 (bottom voice): Stems down, shifted right
/// - Voice 3+: Additional voices as needed
